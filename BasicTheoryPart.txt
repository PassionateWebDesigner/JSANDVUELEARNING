Pseudo-class selector

The specified element(s), but only when in the specified state. (For example, when a cursor hovers over a link.)	
Ex:
a:hover
selects <a>, but only when the mouse pointer is hovering over the link.

Padding, the space around the content. In the example below, it is the space around the paragraph text.
Border, the solid line that is just outside the padding.
Margin, the space around the outside of the border.

Centering the image

  display: block;
  margin: 0 auto;
